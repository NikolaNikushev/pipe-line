	 Appendix - with definition of what we mean and What kind of rules we have
	 Pipeline is not a component is a separate thing
	 Our use cases don't suite the pipeline as a component - we should change it to be separate
	 Why did we wrote twice the removing a componentremoving a pipeline
	 Removing a shape or removing a trianglecircle
	 Update all the flow that comes AFTER the pipeline UC #3
	 #7 User chooses on option on the menu 
	 #8 Again the same problem with the #7
	 NONfunc - Reliability - #3 
	 Auto-save is a good idea of implementation

	 When we do it as a rectangle we will have a nice predefined methods for overlapping and stuff
	 id of the component is the X and Y because it will be unique and it doesnt need ID
	 Aliasing
	 ToolboxComponent The selectedone - we dont need the INMODE boolean
	 Make on visual studio Class Diagram for better performance
