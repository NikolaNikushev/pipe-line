Use cases comments by Bilger Yahov

=========================================================

Lyubomir's use-cases:

- They are short and precise. I think we can copy and paste them to the URS document right away!

=========================================================

Nikola's use-cases:

- I think we do not need use-case "To connect adjustable splitter".
We just need to make a simple use-case for adding an element to the workspace or so-called grid.
You can check it out. I have done it. If you like my idea and my use-case, just remove the one "To connect adjustable splitter".


- "To clear the grid" has an extension about confirmation dialog. This should not be an extension,
it should have been done to be a part of the Main Success Scenario. Then the user should be asked for confirmation. And the answer should be "Yes".
There needs to be an extra extension for answer "No" eventually given by the user. Then the System aborts the operation.

Everything else is OK.

========================================================

Tao's use-cases:

I created a new word file where I have made new use-cases, improvements on Tao's use-cases. I suggest deleting her .docx file and keeping the one
that I created with name use-cases Bilger and Tao

NOTES:
Please format your use-cases in the way that I formatted mine. So we can copy and paste everything right away to the URS document! Look at the comments
that I have written for your use-cases and try to improve them as soon as possible. If you want to discuss something do not hesitate and feel free to discuss! :)

Look carefully at your use-cases and do not forget that we HAVE TO implement the same things that we promise now making these use-cases. Think twice!
The program should run in the same way as the use-case says!

Try to make everything as simple as possible and the program should run very smoothly! Check out my use-cases and look at their simpleness :D
